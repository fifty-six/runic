# Runic

A basic functional programming language, started as a final project for
CMSC488B  

Executable takes a few commands  
`run file`       : Runs the file
`typecheck file` : Typechecks the file without running it
`pretty file`    : Runs the file through the internal pretty-printer

An example/test file for the language is provided as `test.rn`

This can be shown on the class page.
